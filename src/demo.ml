(* This is the main function, it can be named anything you want but `main` is traditional.
  The Program returned here has a set of callbacks that can easily be called from
  Bucklescript or from javascript for running this main attached to an element,
  or even to pass a message into the event loop.  You can even expose the
  constructors to the messages to javascript via the above [@@bs.deriving {accessors}]
  attribute on the `msg` type or manually, that way even javascript can use it safely. *)
